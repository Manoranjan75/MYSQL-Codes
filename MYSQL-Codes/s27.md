# 1907. Count Salary Categories

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Accounts

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |

- `account_id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the monthly income for one bank account.

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

- **Low Salary**: All the salaries strictly less than $20,000.
- **Average Salary**: All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20,000, $50,000].
- **High Salary**: All the salaries strictly greater than $50,000.

The result table must contain **all three categories**. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, 
       COUNT(IF(income < 20000, 1, NULL)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Average Salary', 
       COUNT(IF(income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000, 1, NULL))
FROM Accounts

UNION ALL

SELECT 'High Salary', 
       COUNT(IF(income > 50000, 1, NULL))
FROM Accounts;
