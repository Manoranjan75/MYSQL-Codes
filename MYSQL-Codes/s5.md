# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

---

## Table: Person

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

---

## Problem

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

Note:  
- You are supposed to write a DELETE statement, not a SELECT one.  
- After running your script, the result will be shown in the Person table.  
- The final order of the Person table does not matter.

## SQL Solution

```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
  ON p1.email = p2.email
WHERE p1.id > p2.id;
