# 1393. Capital Gain/Loss

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Stocks

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |

- `(stock_name, operation_day)` is the primary key.
- `operation` is either 'Buy' or 'Sell'.
- Each row indicates a stock operation on a given day with a price.
- Each 'Sell' operation corresponds to a previous 'Buy' operation.
- Each 'Buy' operation corresponds to a future 'Sell' operation.

## Problem Statement

Write a query to report the capital gain or loss for each stock.

The capital gain/loss is the total gain or loss after all buy and sell operations for each stock.

Return the result table in any order.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT stock_name, 
       SUM(
           CASE
               WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
               ELSE price
           END
       ) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name;
