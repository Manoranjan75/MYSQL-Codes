---

## Table: Employee

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the salary of an employee.

---

## Problem

Write a solution to find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table.  
If there are less than n distinct salaries, return null.

---

## SQL Solution

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
  );
END;
