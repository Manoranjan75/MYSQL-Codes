## Table: Scores

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the score of a game.
- Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.

## Problem

Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should follow these rules:

- Scores are ranked from highest to lowest.
- If two scores are the same, they share the same rank.
- The next rank after a tie is the next consecutive integer (no gaps in ranking).
- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM 
    Scores
ORDER BY 
    score DESC;
