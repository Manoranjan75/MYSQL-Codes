# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type  |
|--------------|-------|
| player_id    | int   |
| device_id    | int   |
| event_date   | date  |
| games_played | int   |

- `(player_id, event_date)` is the primary key.
- Each row records a player's login and games played on a certain day using some device.

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again **on the day after** the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places.

In other words, count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

---

## Solution

```sql
-- First, store the first login date of each player
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM Activity 
    GROUP BY player_id
)

-- Calculate fraction of players who logged in the day after their first login
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        SUM(DATEDIFF(a.event_date, t.first_login_date) = 1) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id), 2
    ) AS fraction
FROM Activity a
JOIN temp t ON a.player_id = t.player_id;
