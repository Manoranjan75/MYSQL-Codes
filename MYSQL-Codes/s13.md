---

## Table: Project

| Column Name  | Type |
|--------------|------|
| project_id   | int  |
| employee_id  | int  |

- `(project_id, employee_id)` is the primary key.
- `employee_id` is a foreign key to the Employee table.
- Each row indicates an employee working on a project.

## Table: Employee

|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |

- `employee_id` is the primary key.
- `experience_years` is guaranteed not to be NULL.
- Each row contains information about an employee.

## Problem

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all employees for each project, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e 
ON 
    p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;
