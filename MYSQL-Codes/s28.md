# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

**Difficulty:** Hard

## SQL Schema

### Table: Stadium

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| visit_date  | date |
| people      | int  |

- `visit_date` has unique values.
- `id` is unique and increases with date.
- Each row represents the number of people who visited the stadium on that day.

---

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to display the records with **three or more rows with consecutive ids**, where the number of people is **greater than or equal to 100** for each.

Return the result table ordered by `visit_date` in **ascending** order.

### Example:

**Input:**

```text
Stadium table:
+------+------------+--------+
| id   | visit_date | people |
+------+------------+--------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10     |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109    |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150    |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99     |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145    |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455   |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199    |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188    |
+------+------------+--------+

+------+------------+--------+
| id   | visit_date | people |
+------+------------+--------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145    |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455   |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199    |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188    |
+------+------------+--------+

## Solution

```sql
WITH Filtered AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM Stadium
  WHERE people >= 100
),
Numbered AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS rn
  FROM Filtered
),
Grouped AS (
  SELECT *,
         id - rn AS grp
  FROM Numbered
),
ValidGroups AS (
  SELECT grp
  FROM Grouped
  GROUP BY grp
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
SELECT id, visit_date, people
FROM Grouped
WHERE grp IN (SELECT grp FROM ValidGroups)
ORDER BY visit_date;
