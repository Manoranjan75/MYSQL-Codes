- `name` is the primary key (unique value) for this table.  
- Each row contains information about the name of a country, the continent it belongs to, its area, population, and GDP.

## Problem

A country is considered big if:

- It has an area of at least three million (3,000,000 kmÂ²), or  
- It has a population of at least twenty-five million (25,000,000).

Write a solution to find the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
