# 1321. Restaurant Growth

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Customer

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| customer_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| visited_on  | date    |
| amount      | int     |

- `(customer_id, visited_on)` is the primary key.
- The table contains customer transactions in a restaurant.
- `visited_on` is the date the customer visited.
- `amount` is the total paid by a customer.

## Problem Statement

You are the restaurant owner and want to analyze possible expansion (there is at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a **seven days window** (current day + 6 days before). The `average_amount` should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result ordered by `visited_on` ascending.

---

## Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT visited_on,
       SUM(amount) OVER w AS amount,
       ROUND(SUM(amount) OVER w / 7, 2) AS average_amount
FROM customer
WINDOW w AS (
    ORDER BY visited_on
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
LIMIT 6, 999;
