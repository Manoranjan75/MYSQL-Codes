# 626. Exchange Seats

**Problem:**  
Swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the last student's id remains unchanged.

**Table: Seat**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
