# 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Bus

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Queue

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |

- `person_id` contains unique values.
- The table contains information about all people waiting for a bus.
- `person_id` and `turn` contain numbers from 1 to n, where n is the total number of rows.
- `turn` determines the order in which people board the bus: turn=1 is the first, turn=n is the last.
- `weight` is the weight of the person in kilograms.

## Problem Statement

There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. The bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so some people may not be able to board.

Write a solution to find the **person_name** of the last person who can fit on the bus without the total weight exceeding 1000 kg. The test cases guarantee that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

Only one person can board at a time according to their turn.

## Solution

```sql
WITH weight AS (
    SELECT 
        person_name, 
        weight, 
        turn, 
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS total_weight 
    FROM Queue
)

SELECT person_name 
FROM weight
WHERE total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY turn DESC
LIMIT 1;
