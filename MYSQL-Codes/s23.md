# 1193. Monthly Transactions I

**Difficulty:** Medium

## SQL Schema

### Table: Transactions

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| country     | varchar |
| state       | enum    |
| amount      | int     |
| trans_date  | date    |

- `id` is the primary key.
- The `state` column is an enum with possible values: `"approved"`, `"declined"`.
- The table contains information about incoming transactions.

## Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to find, for each month and country:

- the number of transactions,
- their total amount,
- the number of approved transactions,
- and their total amount.

Return the result table in any order.

---

## Solution

```sql
SELECT  
    SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) AS month, 
    country, 
    COUNT(id) AS trans_count, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count, 
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country;
