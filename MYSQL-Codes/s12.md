# 1068. Product Sales Analysis I

---

## Table: Sales

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| sale_id     | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| year        | int  |
| quantity    | int  |
| price       | int  |

- `(sale_id, year)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values).
- `product_id` is a foreign key referencing the `Product` table.
- Each row shows a sale of the product in a certain year.
- The price is per unit.

## Table: Product

|--------------|---------|
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |

- `product_id` is the primary key.
- Each row indicates the product name.
