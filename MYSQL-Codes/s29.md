# 262. Trips and Users

**Problem:**  
Find the cancellation rate of trips for each day between **2013-10-01** and **2013-10-03**, considering only trips where **both the client and the driver are unbanned**.  
The cancellation rate is defined as the number of canceled trips (`'cancelled_by_driver'` or `'cancelled_by_client'`) divided by the total number of trips for that day.  
Round the result to **two decimal places**.

**Table: Trips**

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | varchar  |

**Table: Users**

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |

**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
    request_at AS Day, 
    ROUND(SUM(status LIKE 'cancelled%') * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM 
    Trips
WHERE 
    (client_id, driver_id) IN (
        SELECT 
            U1.users_id, U2.users_id 
        FROM 
            Users U1 
            JOIN Users U2 
        WHERE 
            U1.banned = 'No' AND 
            U2.banned = 'No'
    )
    AND request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY 
    request_at;
